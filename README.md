# Dotfiles Configuration for Linux Zshell
(Need to add the image)


# Instructions
### View your current Shell
Use `echo $SHELL` in your terminal to view the current shell
that the terminal is using.

### Install Zsh
`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install zsh`

### Change the default Shell to Zsh

### Want to change back? (Bash in this demonstration)
`chsh -s $(which bash)`

##

### Zshrc
This configuration was originally the default Zsh setup from 
Kali Linux. I was impressed by the structure and features 
that Kali includes by default, so I decided to customize it 
extensively to suit my preferences.


### [Note]
This configuration includes Zsh Syntax Highlighting setup. 
You only need to install it to activate the functionality.

Zsh Syntax Highlighting
`sudo apt install zsh-syntax-highlighting`
