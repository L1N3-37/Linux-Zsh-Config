# Dotfiles Configuration for Linux Zshell
(Need to add the image)


# Instructions
### View your current Shell
Use `echo $SHELL` in your terminal to view the current shell
that the terminal is using.

### Install Zsh
`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install zsh`

### Change the default Shell to Zsh
`chsh -s $(which zsh)`

### Want to change back? (Bash in this demonstration)
`chsh -s $(which bash)`

##

### Zshrc
This config was originally the Kali Linux's default
config for Zshell. Since I really liked the structure
and the features Kali comes with by deafult I decided
to heavily customize it to my linking.

### [Note]
This config comes with Zsh Syntax Highlighting set up
meaning you would only need to install it to get it working.

Zsh Syntax Highlighting
`sudo apt install zsh-syntax-highlighting`
